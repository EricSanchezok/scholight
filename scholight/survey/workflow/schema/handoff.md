# Handoff Contract

Every node ends its turn with a **handoff**: the final assistant message that the
graph carries on the `context` channel to the next node. The handoff is *not* the
artifact — full data always lives in `run_dir` files. The handoff only tells the
next node where to look and how the run is doing.

Keep it short: at most ~15 lines, one `key: value` per line.

## This must be your LAST message — and it carries run_dir downstream

The graph forwards only your **last message** to the next node. If your last
message is a tool result (e.g. a file-write receipt) or any text without
`run_dir`, the next node receives no run_dir and has to guess it. So:

- Do all your file writes and tool calls **first**.
- Then send the handoff as a **plain text message with no tool call**, so it is
  the final fragment in your context.
- `run_dir` must be the **first line**. Scholight starts the workflow with
  `--run-dir`, so cwd *is* the job workspace and every node must use `.` as
  `run_dir`. Do not discover, create, or switch to another workspace.

## Required keys

- `run_dir`: the run directory, verbatim. **Must be the first line.** The whole
  chain depends on this to find upstream artifacts.
- `artifact`: the primary file this node wrote, relative to `run_dir`. Producer
  nodes always set this; a pure gate may omit it.
- `status`: `ok` | `partial` | `degraded` | `blocked`. Use `degraded` when an
  optional capability failed but downstream work can safely continue.

## Optional keys (include only what applies; omit empty ones)

- `counts`: small integers as `k=v` pairs, e.g. `total=42, core=8, method=12`.
- `ids`: up to 5 representative paper IDs, titles, benchmark names, or other
  named entities.
- `verdict`: judge or gate nodes only — `strong` | `acceptable` | `insufficient` | `blocked`.
- `risks`: up to 3 short caveats (scope drift, benchmark mismatch, missing evidence…).
- `next`: up to 3 follow-up queries or actions for another retrieval loop.

## run_dir invariant

`run_dir` is the single key the whole chain shares. Rules:

1. Use `run_dir: .` from incoming context.
2. If incoming context has no `run_dir`, return `status: blocked`; never inspect
   sibling directories or create a replacement workspace.
3. The Scholight worker is the only component that creates a run directory.

## Example

```
run_dir: .
artifact: ./02a_method_candidates.md
status: ok
counts: candidates=14
ids: 2306.14048, 2401.18079, 2404.06654, 2503.24000, 2308.14508
risks: 2 titles lacked arXiv IDs; kept by title
```

Do not paste full search results, PDF text, tables, or artifact bodies into the handoff.
