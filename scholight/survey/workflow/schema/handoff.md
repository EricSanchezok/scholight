# Handoff Contract

Every node ends its turn with a **handoff**: the final assistant message that the
graph carries on the `context` channel to the next node. The handoff is *not* the
artifact — full data always lives in `run_dir` files. The handoff only tells the
next node where to look and how the run is doing.

Keep it short: at most ~15 lines, one `key: value` per line.

## This must be your LAST message — and it carries run_dir downstream

The graph forwards only your **last message** to the next node. If your last
message is a tool result (e.g. a file-write receipt) or any text without
`run_dir`, the next node receives no run_dir and has to guess it. So:

- Do all your file writes and tool calls **first**.
- Then send the handoff as a **plain text message with no tool call**, so it is
  the final fragment in your context.
- `run_dir` must be the **first line**, verbatim, in the exact form you received
  it (e.g. `runs/20260603T120600Z`) — do not add a prefix, do not make it
  absolute. The next node will use it as-is to build paths.
  **Exception:** when the env fragment contains an absolute `run_dir:` (set via
  `--run-dir`), use `.` (the current directory) as the run_dir in your handoff
  — because cwd *is* the run directory, and writing `run_dir/<file>` puts files
  at the right place without nesting.

## Required keys

- `run_dir`: the run directory, verbatim. **Must be the first line.** The whole
  chain depends on this to find upstream artifacts.
- `artifact`: the primary file this node wrote, relative to repo root. Producer
  nodes always set this; a pure gate may omit it.
- `status`: `ok` | `partial` | `blocked`.

## Optional keys (include only what applies; omit empty ones)

- `counts`: small integers as `k=v` pairs, e.g. `total=42, core=8, method=12`.
- `ids`: up to 5 representative arXiv IDs / titles / names.
- `verdict`: judge or gate nodes only — `strong` | `acceptable` | `insufficient` | `blocked`.
- `risks`: up to 3 short caveats (scope drift, benchmark mismatch, missing evidence…).
- `next`: up to 3 follow-up queries or actions for another retrieval loop.

## run_dir invariant

`run_dir` is the single key the whole chain shares. Rules:

1. Prefer `run_dir` from incoming context.
2. If incoming context has no `run_dir` (e.g. running this unit standalone), you
   may fall back to the newest run directory: `fs list` the `runs` directory
   **directly** (listing its parent hides it — `runs/` is gitignored) and pick
   the last entry, since the UTC timestamp names sort chronologically. You
   **must** then add a `risks:` line saying the run_dir was recovered from disk,
   not from context. Never switch run_dir silently.
3. `anchor` is the only node that creates a new `run_dir`.

## Example

```
run_dir: runs/20260530T144227Z
artifact: runs/20260530T144227Z/02a_method_candidates.md
status: ok
counts: candidates=14
ids: 2306.14048, 2401.18079, 2404.06654, 2503.24000, 2308.14508
risks: 2 titles lacked arXiv IDs; kept by title
```

Do not paste full search results, PDF text, tables, or artifact bodies into the handoff.
